tags: c++, templates

* "Policies have much in common with traits but differ in that they put less emphasis on type and more on behavior" ~ Andrei Alexandrescu in "Modern C++ Design".

* Policies represent behavior for generic functions and types.

* "Traits class: A class used in place of template parameters. As a class it aggregates useful types and constants; as a template, it provides an avenue for that 'extra level of indirection' that solves all software problems" ~ Nathan Myers - he introduces the traits technique to template programming.

* Traits represent additional properties of a template parameter that are natural for that type.
