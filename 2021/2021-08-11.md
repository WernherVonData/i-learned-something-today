* Python has a special member function called `\_\_call\_\_\()` that allows to call class just like with the operator() in C++.

```
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Instance Created")

    def __call__(self):
        print("Instance is called via special method")
  
e = Example()
e()
```

Will give:
```
Instance Created
Instance is called via special method
```
