* Usually, if you can take an address of the object you are having an lvalue otherwise, it's usually the rvalue.

* std::move and std::forward don't move and forward anything! std::move performs unconditionally casting its argument to the rvalue, while std::forward does it when a particular condition is fulfilled (the argument of std::foward has to be initialized with rvalue).

* Making move requests on copy objects calls copy requests instead.
