* Gmock contains an `ON_CALL` functionality, that allows mocks to set some behaviour. For example `ON_CALL(mock, fun1()).WillByDefault(Action);` makes `mock` to perform `Action` upon calling `fun1()` on it.

* We can return values from such action for by `Return()` or by `ReturnRef` - which will return a direct reference to the provided element.
